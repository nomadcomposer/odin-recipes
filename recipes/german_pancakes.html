        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This German pancake recipe is light, fluffy, and easy to make with ingredients you likely already have on hand. </p>
        <p>A German pancake (a.k.a. a Dutch baby) is similar to a large Yorkshire pudding. Unlike other types of pancakes, German pancakes are baked in the oven instead of fried on the stove. They also do not contain leaving ingredients, such as baking powder or baking soda.</p>
